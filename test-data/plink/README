The BED/BIM/FAM files under the directory small-test were generated by calling PLINK 1
(http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink) on the MAP/PED files under the map-ped directory:
    plink --file map-ped/small-test --make-bed --out small-test/small-test
These BED/BIM/FAM files were copied to the no-bim and no-fam drectories.

The VCF file under the directory vcf was generated using PLINK 1.9 (https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/) on the
BED/BIM/FAM files under the small-test directory:
    plink --bfile small-test/small-test --recode vcf --out vcf

The prematurely-truncated BED file under the directory malformed was generated by running the following commands on
the BED file from the small-test directory:
    cp small-test/small-test.bed malformed/small-test.bed
    truncate -s -1 malformed/small-test.bed
